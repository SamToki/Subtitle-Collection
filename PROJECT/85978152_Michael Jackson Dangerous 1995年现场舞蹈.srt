[Song: "Dangerous"]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there...

2
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,800
There was something different about this girl.

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,500
The way she moved, her hair, her face, her lines,

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,600
...divinity in motion.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,800
As she stalked the room,

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,400
I could feel the aura of her presence.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,200
Every head turned, feeling passion and lust.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,900
The girl was persuasive. The girl I could not trust.

00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,000
The girl was bad...

She came at me in sections, with the eyes of desire.

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,900
I felt trapped into her web of sin.

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,000
A touch, a kiss,

14
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,200
...a whisper of love.

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I was at the point of no return.

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,800
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity.

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,400
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,300
...was persuasive. This girl I could not trust.

19
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,200
