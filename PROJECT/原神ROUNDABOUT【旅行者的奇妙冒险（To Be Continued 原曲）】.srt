1
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,150
我将成为环岛
I'll be the roundabout

2
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,740
我的话语会让你脱离尘世
The words will make you out and out

3
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,050
以你自己的方式过日子吧
And spend the day your way

4
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,150
就像清晨行驶在山谷里 听着挥之不去的回响
Call it morning driving through the sound and in and out the valley

5
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,300
音乐飘荡 载歌载舞
The music dance and sing

6
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,800
令孩子们兴高采烈
They make the children really ring

7
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,250
我也以你的方式过日子吧
I'll spend the day your way

8
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:20,850
就像清晨行驶在山谷里 听着挥之不去的回响
Call it morning driving through the sound and in and out the valley

9
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,550
在湖里及其周边
In and around the lake

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,250
崇山峻岭高耸入云 矗立于此
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

11
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,170
还有一英里我们就会见到你
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

12
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,650
十载夏日时光留下了我们的欢笑
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too

13
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,450
在我邂逅爱情之前 青春逝去之前
Twenty four before my love you'll see

14
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,050
我会陪伴在你身边
I'll be there with you

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,400
我会将你铭记于心
I will remember you

16
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:18,550
你的剪影会牵动远方的景色
Your silhouette will charge the view of distant atmosphere

17
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,100
就像清晨行驶在山谷里 听着挥之不去的回响
Call it morning driving through the sound and even in the valley

18
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,350
在湖里及其周边
In and around the lake

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,450
崇山峻岭高耸入云 矗立于此
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there

20
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,370
还有一英里我们就会见到你
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you

21
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,850
十载夏日时光留下了我们的欢笑
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too

22
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,600
在我邂逅爱情之前 青春逝去之前
Twenty four before my love you'll see

23
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,340
我会陪伴在你身边
I'll be there with you

24
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,600
沿着漂流的浮云 雄鹰在陆地上寻觅
Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching down on the land

25
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,550
乘着大风大浪 水手看见了海天相交的地方
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees the rim of the land

26
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,650
雄鹰挥动的翅膀像天气一样变幻莫测
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand

27
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,750
靠近些 拥抱这大地 感觉自己不过是渺小如一粒尘埃
Go closer hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand

28
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,350
我们牺牲所有不过是为了追寻人生的答案 主宰自己的命运
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand

29
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,750
我们与内心深处的恐惧为邻 千万年来未曾改变
Next to your deeper fears we stand surrounded by a million years

30
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,350
我将成为环岛
I'll be the roundabout

31
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,850
我的话语会让你脱离尘世
The words will make you out and out

32
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,600
我将成为环岛
I'll be the roundabout

33
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:32,750
我的话语会让你脱离尘世……
The words will make you out and out...

34
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,050
在湖里及其周边
In and around the lake

35
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:19,950
崇山峻岭高耸入云 矗立于此
Mountains come out of the sky, they stand there

36
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,850
在我的青春逝去之前 我会陪伴在你身边……
Twenty four before my love and I'll be there...

37
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,050
我将成为环岛

00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:01,150
就像清晨行驶在山谷里 听着挥之不去的回响
Call it morning driving through the sound and in and out the valley

41
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,500
在湖里及其周边
